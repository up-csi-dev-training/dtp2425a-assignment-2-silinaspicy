# DTP Assignment 2

This assignment is all about GitHub. It is divided into two parts.

## Part 1: Share your Poem
You will have to create a poem in `src/poem.txt` and push it to your repository. The poem must have greater than **20** non-empty lines, including the title. Feel free to search for your favorite poems online.

> [!NOTE]
> Since the repository is generated publicly, it will be visible to other DTP participants.

## Part 2: Contribute to Others' Poems
You will have to contribute one pull request to at least **three (3)** of your fellow participants' repositories. Possible contribution includes correcting grammar/spelling, adding title/more lines, substituting words, etc. As much as possible, let's choose repositories that have the fewest pull requests thus far to keep things even.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that a pull request is only counted as your contribution when merged by the owner of the repository.
